Update Log:
v0.2
- Created this readme.txt
- Added home.php, definitions.php, stylizer.php, _dashicons.scss, _menuicons.scss
- Stylized dashicons
- Theme Customizer: added menu color
- Print css overrides thru stylizer.php. Note that style.css also keeps default
   values and by itself should complete the design. But customizer should always
   be able to override the default values.
v0.1
- Fresh copy of _s generated theme
